## Overview

Create an e-commerce admin dashboard using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This assignment will test your ability to build a functional and visually appealing frontend application while implementing authentication and data management.

## Requirements

### Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Tanstack Query (recommended for data fetching)

### Features

### Dashboard Layout

- Create a responsive dashboard layout with:
    - Sidebar navigation
    - Header with user info and logout option
    - Main content area

### Products Management

- Fetch and display products from the Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/)
- Display products in a grid/table format with:
    - Product image
    - Title
    - Price
    - Category
    - Rating
    - Stock status (you can simulate this)

### Filtering System

Implement the following filters:

- Price range (min/max slider)
- Category filter (dropdown or checkbox)
- Rating filter (star rating selector)
- Search by product name

### Additional Features

Candidates should implement these features in order of priority:

1. Product detail view when clicking on a product
2. Pagination or infinite scroll for product list
3. Dark/light mode toggle
4. Simple analytics or statistics at the top of the dashboard (total products, average price, etc.)
5. Mock functionality to add/edit/delete products (changes don't need to persist)

### API Integration

Use the Fake Store API for product data:

- Product list: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products`
- Single product: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products/{id}`
- Categories: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products/categories`
- Filter by category: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products/category/{category_name}`

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality and folder organization
- UI/UX design and implementation
- TypeScript usage (proper typing)
- Component reusability
- Responsive design implementation
- Filter functionality
- Error handling
